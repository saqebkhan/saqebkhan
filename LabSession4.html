    <h3>Lesson #1: Lead by Example</h3>

    <p> “If you’re co-founder or CEO<mark> you have to do all kinds of tasks you might not want to do</mark> … If you don’t do your
        chores, the company won’t succeed … Elon Musk No task is too menial.” – Elon Musk <mark>“Just work like hell.</mark> If other
        people are putting in 40 hour work weeks and you’re putting in 100 hour work weeks, even if you’re doing the
        same
        thing, you know that you will achieve in four months what it takes them a year to achieve.”- Elon Musk One thing
        we
        all control is our own effort. Elon Musk realizes that his <mark>thoughts will only change the world</mark> if implemented
        and
        executed upon. He is known for his tenacious work ethic to see through his visions.</p>

    <h3>Lesson #2: Lead with Purpose</h3>

    <p>“You have to have a very compelling goal for the company.<mark> If you put yourself in the shoes of someone who’s
        talented at a world level,</mark> they have to believe that there’s potential for a great outcome and believe in the
        leader of the company, that you’re the right guy to work with. That can be a difficult thing, especially if
        you’re trying to attract people from other companies.”- Elon Musk Elon’s purpose is simple. He is determined to
        revolutionize three industries. He has said that he didn’t start Space X because he thought building rocket
        ships were going to be great for his portfolio; Space X is his way of making his mark on the world. No matter
        what the goal,<mark> leaders must develop a vision for where they would like to be and work until they reach their
        destination.</mark> In Elon’s case, that place is Mars.</p>

    <h3>Lesson #3: Be Creative</h3>

    <p>“The problem is that at a lot of big companies, the process becomes a substitute for thinking. You’re encouraged
        to behave like a little gear in a complex machine. Frankly, it allows you to keep people who aren’t that smart,
        who aren’t that creative.”- Elon Musk Elon Musk believes that<mark> process prohibits the ability for innovation to
        take place. In many cases, continued formal education can be a negative because it denies creativity. Without
        creativity, </mark>progress and innovation are impossible</p>

    <h3>Lesson #4: Be Collaborative</h3>

    <p>“Talent is extremely important. It’s like a sports team, the team that has the best individual player will often
        win but then there’s a multiplier from how those players work together and the strategy they employ.”- Elon Musk
        Musk understands that<mark> teamwork is a necessity for any team or business to succeed.</mark> It is integral to employ a
        team that operates in a cohesive and team-oriented fashion. This sense of pride in team success has to start
        with the leadership. Elon Musk leads by <mark>“doing” more than “telling”. Set an example that inspires your team to
        succeed as one</mark>.</p>

    <h3>Lesson #5: Encourage Innovation</h3>

    <p><mark>“Failure is an option here. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough.”</mark>- Elon Musk At Space X,
        their first 3 launches failed. Musk took that as an opportunity to learn and innovate. If someone is confined to
        the walls of which process does not allow expansion, innovation is impossible. Elon Musk enables and encourages
        employees to step out of the “traditional” way of thinking and to put all new ideas forth.</p>
