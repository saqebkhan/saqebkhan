<h1>JavaScript</h1>
<h3>Wikipedia</h3>
<P>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[9] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

<p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[10] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[11] often incorporating third-party libraries.[12] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.

</p>

<hr>
<p>As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

</p>
<hr>
<p>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

<h1>History</h1>

<h2>Creation At Netscape</h2>
<p>The Mosaic web browser was released in 1993. As the first browser with a graphical user interface accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide Web.[13] The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. Navigator quickly became the most used browser.[14]

<p>During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the burgeoning web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.[5]

<h1>Adaption By Microsoft</h1>
<p>Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape. On the JavaScript front, Microsoft reverse-engineered the Navigator interpreter to create its own, called JScript</p>
<hr>
<p>JScript was first released in 1996, alongside initial support for CSS and extensions to HTML. Each of these implementations was noticeably different from their counterparts in Navigator.[17][18] These differences made it difficult for developers to make their websites work well in both browsers, leading to widespread use of "best viewed in Netscape" and "best viewed in Internet Explorer" logos for several years.
